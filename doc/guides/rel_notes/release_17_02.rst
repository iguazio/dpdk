New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release. Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense. The description
     should be enough to allow someone scanning the release notes to understand
     the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list like this.

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     =========================================================

* **Added generic EAL API for I/O device memory read/write operations.**

  This API introduces 8-bit, 16-bit, 32bit, 64bit I/O device
  memory read/write operations along with the relaxed versions.

  The weakly-ordered machine like ARM needs additional I/O barrier for
  device memory read/write access over PCI bus.
  By introducing the EAL abstraction for I/O device memory read/write access,
  The drivers can access I/O device memory in architecture-agnostic manner.
  The relaxed version does not have additional I/O memory barrier, useful in
  accessing the device registers of integrated controllers which
  implicitly strongly ordered with respect to memory access.

* **Added generic flow API (rte_flow).**

  This API provides a generic means to configure hardware to match specific
  ingress or egress traffic, alter its fate and query related counters
  according to any number of user-defined rules.

  It is slightly higher-level than the legacy filtering framework which it
  encompasses and supersedes (including all functions and filter types) in
  order to expose a single interface with an unambiguous behavior that is
  common to all poll-mode drivers (PMDs).

  See the :ref:`Generic flow API <Generic_flow_API>` documentation for more
  information.

* **Added firmware version get API.**

  Added a new function ``rte_eth_dev_fw_version_get()`` to fetch firmware
  version by a given device.

* **Added APIs for MACsec offload support to the ixgbe PMD.**

  Six new APIs have been added to the ixgbe PMD for MACsec offload support.
  The declarations for the APIs can be found in ``rte_pmd_ixgbe.h``.

* **Added I219 NICs support.**

  Added support for I219 Intel 1GbE NICs.

* **Added VF Daemon (VFD) on i40e. - EXPERIMENTAL**

  This's an EXPERIMENTAL feature to enhance the capability of DPDK PF as many
  VF management features are not supported by kernel PF driver.
  Some new private APIs are implemented in PMD without abstrction layer.
  They can be used directly by some users who have the need.

  The new APIs to control VFs directly from PF include,
  1) set VF MAC anti-spoofing
  2) set VF VLAN anti-spoofing
  3) set TX loopback
  4) set VF unicast promiscuous mode
  5) set VF multicast promiscuous mode
  6) set VF MTU
  7) get/reset VF stats
  8) set VF MAC address
  9) set VF VLAN stripping
  10) VF VLAN insertion
  12) set VF broadcast mode
  13) set VF VLAN tag
  14) set VF VLAN filter
  VFD also includes VF to PF mailbox message management by APP.
  When PF receives mailbox messages from VF, PF should call the callback
  provided by APP to know if they're permitted to be processed.

  As an EXPERIMENTAL feature, please aware it can be changed or even
  removed without prior notice.

* **Updated the i40e base driver.**

  updated the i40e base driver, including the following changes:

  * replace existing legacy memcpy() calls with i40e_memcpy() calls.
  * use BIT() macro instead of bit fields
  * add clear all WoL filters implementation
  * add broadcast promiscuous control per VLAN
  * remove unused X722_SUPPORT and I40E_NDIS_SUPPORT MARCOs

* **Added Solarflare libefx-based network PMD.**

  A new network PMD which supports Solarflare SFN7xxx and SFN8xxx family
  of 10/40 Gbps adapters has been added.

* **Added support for Mellanox ConnectX-5 adapters (mlx5).**

  Support for Mellanox ConnectX-5 family of 10/25/40/50/100 Gbps adapters
  has been added to the existing mlx5 PMD.

* **virtio-user with vhost-kernel as another exceptional path.**

  Previously, we upstreamed a virtual device, virtio-user with vhost-user
  as the backend, as a way for IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and user
  space container networking.

  Virtio-user with vhost-kernel as the backend is a solution for exceptional
  path, such as KNI, which exchanges packets with kernel networking stack.
  This solution is very promising in:

  * maintenance: vhost and vhost-net (kernel) is upstreamed and extensively
    used kernel module.
  * features: vhost-net is born to be a networking solution, which has
    lots of networking related features, like multi-queue, TSO, multi-seg
    mbuf, etc.
  * performance: similar to KNI, this solution would use one or more
    kthreads to send/receive packets from user space DPDK applications,
    which has little impact on user space polling thread (except that
    it might enter into kernel space to wake up those kthreads if
    necessary).

* **Added virtio Rx interrupt suppprt.**

  This feature enables Rx interrupt mode for virtio pci net devices as
  binded to VFIO (noiommu mode) and drived by virtio PMD.

  With this feature, virtio PMD can switch between polling mode and
  interrupt mode, to achieve best performance, and at the same time save
  power. It can work on both legacy and modern virtio devices. At this mode,
  each rxq is mapped with an exluded MSIx interrupt.

  See the :ref:`Virtio Interrupt Mode <virtio_interrupt_mode>` documentation
  for more information.

* **Added ARMv8 crypto PMD.**

  A new crypto PMD has been added, which provides combined mode cryptografic
  operations optimized for ARMv8 processors. The driver can be used to enhance
  performance in processing chained operations such as cipher + HMAC.

* **Updated the QAT PMD.**

  The QAT PMD was updated with additional support for:

  * DES algorithm.
  * Scatter-gather list (SGL) support.

* **Updated the AESNI MB PMD.**

  * The Intel(R) Multi Buffer Crypto for IPsec library used in
    AESNI MB PMD has been moved to a new repository, in GitHub.
  * Support for single operations (cipher only and authentication only).

* **Updated the AES-NI GCM PMD.**

  The AES-NI GCM PMD was migrated from MB library to ISA-L library.
  The migration entailed the following additional support for:

  * GMAC algorithm.
  * 256-bit cipher key.
  * Session-less mode.
  * Out-of place processing
  * Scatter-gatter support for chained mbufs (only out-of place and destination
    mbuf must be contiguous)

* **Added crypto performance test application.**

  A new performance test application allows measuring performance parameters
  of PMDs available in crypto tree.

* **Added Elastic Flow Distributor library (rte_efd).**

  This new library uses perfect hashing to determine a target/value for a
  given incoming flow key.

  It does not store the key itself for lookup operations, and therefore,
  lookup performance is not dependent on the key size. Also, the target/value
  can be any arbitrary value (8 bits by default). Finally, the storage requirement
  is much smaller than a hash-based flow table and therefore, it can better fit for
  CPU cache, being able to scale to millions of flow keys.

  See the :ref:`Elastic Flow Distributor Library <Efd_Library>` documentation in
  the Programmers Guide document, for more information.
